# Bark
One stop shop for all your wood needs!
Bark is a mod that aims to unify everything wood in modded Minecraft.
Right now, it adds bark blocks, stairs, log stumps, and also has integration for the mod Rustic and adds chairs and table variants of bark blocks. For future versions, I will be identifying all modded wood types, and integrating them in this mod.
I am also planning to add other natural decorational blocks, like tatami mats, and bushes.
